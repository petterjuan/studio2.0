## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Local Development

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine. This is a crucial step to ensure all services, including Firebase and Stripe, are properly connected.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher recommended)
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- A Firebase project (you can create one for free at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/))
- A Stripe account (for payment processing)

### 2. Clone the Repository (if applicable)

```bash
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd [REPOSITORY_NAME]
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all project dependencies. This may take a few minutes.

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

This is the most critical step for launching the application. All secret keys and configuration values are managed in a single `.env` file, which you must create in the root of the project. **Never commit the `.env` file to version control.**

Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the necessary environment variables for Firebase, Stripe, and Google AI, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys.

### 5. Run the Development Server

Once the environment variables are set, you can start the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9000`.

## üîß Key Integrations

### Firebase

- **Authentication:** The authentication flow leverages both client-side and server-side logic. User creation (`createUserWithEmailAndPassword`) is handled on the client for an immediate sign-in experience. Server Actions are then used to validate data and create a corresponding user document in Firestore using the server-verified auth token.
- **Firestore:** Used to store user profiles (including an `isAdmin` field for access control), user-generated workout plans, and AI-generated blog articles.
- **Server SDK:** The Firebase Admin SDK (`firebase-admin`) is used in Server Actions to perform privileged backend operations, such as fetching data for all users in the admin panel.

### Stripe

The payment flow is handled via **Stripe Checkout**.
1.  A user clicks the "Buy Now" button on a product or coaching page.
2.  A **Server Action** is invoked.
3.  This action securely creates a Stripe `checkout.Session` on the server-side, using a predefined `stripePriceId` associated with each product.
4.  The application redirects the user to the secure Stripe checkout URL to complete the purchase.
5.  **Important:** If the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is not set in your `.env` file, this flow is **simulated**. The user will be redirected directly to a success page to allow for local development and testing without requiring Stripe keys.

### Personalization Engine (Genkit)

- **Workout Plan Generator:** The `workoutPlanGeneratorFlow` (`src/ai/flows/workout-plan-generator.ts`) uses a structured prompt to create high-quality, personalized weekly workout plans based on user inputs.
- **Recipe Generator:** The `recipeGeneratorFlow` (`src/ai/flows/recipe-generator.ts`) creates delicious recipes from a given ingredient and dietary preferences.
- **Shopping Assistant:** The `shoppingAssistantFlow` (`src/ai/flows/shopping-assistant.ts`) processes the user's query and chat history. It uses a `searchProductsTool` to allow the model to dynamically search the product catalog and provide intelligent recommendations.
- **Automated Blog Writer:** The `blogGeneratorFlow` (`src/ai/flows/blog-generator.ts`) is triggered by a weekly cron job. It generates a new, SEO-friendly article on women's fitness and saves it directly to the Firestore database.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is optimized for **Firebase App Hosting**.

Deployment is managed automatically through the Firebase Studio workflow. Each time a change is committed, a new build and deployment can be initiated.

The `apphosting.yaml` file in the root contains the basic configuration for the App Hosting environment, including the scheduled job for automated blog creation. No manual CI/CD setup is needed.
